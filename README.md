# Geodesic Distance Calculation with fp64Lib

An Arduino project that showcases the utilization of `fp64Lib` for performing high precision floating-point arithmetic when calculating geodesic distances using Vincenty and Haversine formulas. Includes simple timing benchmarks to compare the precision and time cost of each function.

## Overview

The `GeodesicDistance_main.cpp` file in this repository demonstrates the application of `fp64Lib` in geodesic distance calculations. It provides implementations using both Vincenty and Haversine geodesic distance formulas, along with timing metrics for comparison.

## Contents

- `GeodesicDistance_main.cpp`: The main C++ file showcasing the use of `fp64Lib` for geodesic distance calculations.
- `fp64Lib`: Mention any specific version or reference to the `fp64Lib` used in this project.
- `Documentation`: Links or references to any relevant documentation used.

## Getting Started

To run the code:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed, including the `fp64Lib`.
3. Compile and execute `GeodesicDistance_main.cpp` using an Arduino compatible compiler.
4. View the output to observe the calculated geodesic distances and the timing comparison.
